**Arcanum** is a retro-inspired 8-bit fantasy game that immerses players in a pixel-art world of magic, monsters, and mystery. Players can choose from **five unique character classes**, each offering distinct abilities and play styles—ranging from powerful spellcasters to agile melee fighters. The game challenges players to navigate a dangerous **maze-like dungeon**, uncover secrets, and battle through waves of enemies, all leading up to a climactic **boss fight** that tests their skill and strategy. With its nostalgic aesthetic and class-based gameplay, Arcanum delivers a fun and challenging experience for fans of classic fantasy games.
