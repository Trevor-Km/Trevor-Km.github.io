## About Me 🖥️

Hi, I’m Trevor Kulczycki-McIntyre, a **Web** and **IoT** Developer based in Montreal. I enjoy building practical, real-world applications that combine software and hardware. I’m especially proud of projects like SmartHome, a smart automation system, and SmartShelf, a modular inventory tracking app. My focus is on functionality, security, and user experience. I'm confident working with **Java** and **PHP**, and I love turning technical challenges into clean, working solutions. Outside of development, I spend my time fishing, lifting, and exploring new ideas in tech.

## What's Next... 🚀

I plan to study **Software Engineering** at Concordia University, where I can further develop my technical skills, deepen my understanding of large-scale systems, and collaborate with others on innovative projects. I’m especially interested in building scalable, connected systems that bring value in both industrial and consumer settings.


I'm **Trevor Kulczycki-McIntyre**, and I thank you for reading this.
